This folder contains experiment data and results for the submitted NAACL2013 paper
entitled "Answer Extraction as Sequence Tagging with Tree Edit Distance".


==== Data ====

The data files are in pseudo-xml format (html characters are not escaped):

train-less-than-40.manual-edit.xml: TRAIN in paper
train2393.cleanup.xml.gz:           TRAIN-ALL in paper
dev-less-than-40.manual-edit.xml:   DEV in paper
test-less-than-40.manual-edit.xml:  TEST in paper

The dataset was first released and then organized by the following papers:

Mengqiu Wang, Noah A. Smith, and Teruko Mitamura. 2007. What is the Jeopardy model? a quasi-synchronous grammar for QA. In Proceedings of the 2007 Joint Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning (EMNLP-CoNLL), pages 22–32, Prague, Czech Republic, June.  

Michael Heilman and Noah A. Smith. 2010. Tree edit models for recognizing textual entailments, paraphrases, and answers to questions. In Proceedings of NAACL 2010, pages 1011–1019, Los Angeles, California, June.

Then for the task of answer extraction, it was processed in the following steps:

1. exact numbers are recovered (in the original data numbers are replaced with <num>).
2. each positive sentence is matched against the TREC pattern file to identify the answer fragments
3. if multiple match, then manually inspect it.

The "results" folder contains system output for the answer extraction task.
